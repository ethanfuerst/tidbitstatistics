My portfolio site. Hosted on S3.

Can you tell I'm not a web designer?

If you want to deploy the site manually, install python and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then `flask run`
But why would you want to do that?

to do:

- protect main branch and trigger freeze_and_deploy.py when pr is merged
- update plotly and transfer dashboards to modal
- add "last updated at" value to home page of website
